Great! Here's an **enhanced prompt** combining **Flight Plan creation** with a **Flight Log tracking system**, so users can not only plan their drone missions but also **log their real-world flights** for record-keeping, compliance, and review.

### ✈️ Prompt: Implement Flight Plan & Flight Log Tracking System with Database Storage

I want to build a full-featured **Flight Planning and Logging** system in my web application. The system should allow **registered users** to:

---

### ✅ Part 1: Flight Plan System

1. **Create & Save Flight Plans**
   - Draw flight paths (polyline or polygon) on the map.
   - Capture metadata:
     - Title of operation
     - Category (Micro, Basic, Advanced)
     - Operation area bounds
     - Pilot location
     - Tools used (Measurement tool, zone overlays, etc.)
     - Additional notes
   - Save the data in database (MongoDB/PostgreSQL).
   - Allow downloading flight plan as PDF/GeoJSON.

2. **View/Edit/Delete Flight Plans**
   - Show a list of saved flight plans.
   - Include timestamp, preview map, and summary.
   - Options to update or delete a plan.

---

### ✅ Part 2: Flight Log System

1. **Flight Log Entry**
   - After completing a flight, users should be able to **log the mission details**, either by:
     - Selecting a previous Flight Plan and attaching a flight log to it.
     - Or logging a **free-form** flight (no prior plan).
   - Input Fields:
     - Flight Plan ID (if available)
     - Drone used (dropdown)
     - Pilot in command
     - Observers/crew (optional)
     - Start/End time
     - Actual flight coordinates or track (optional)
     - Weather conditions
     - Mission notes / incident notes
     - Attachments (images, videos, documents)

2. **Store in Database**
Example MongoDB schema:
```json
{
  "userId": "abc123",
  "flightPlanId": "xyz789", 
  "droneModel": "DJI Mavic 3 Enterprise",
  "startTime": "2025-04-12T14:00:00Z",
  "endTime": "2025-04-12T14:30:00Z",
  "flightTrack": [
    { "lat": 27.6984, "lng": 85.3245 },
    { "lat": 27.6987, "lng": 85.3250 }
  ],
  "notes": "Smooth mission. Windy near the hilltop.",
  "attachments": [ "photo1.jpg", "logfile.csv" ],
  "createdAt": "2025-04-12T14:35:00Z"
}
```

3. **View Past Flight Logs**
   - Add a **“My Logs”** section with:
     - Search by date or drone type
     - Preview map of track flown
     - Mission summary
     - Link back to original Flight Plan if available
     - Export as PDF/CSV

---

### ✅ Optional Add-ons:
- Real-time location tracking during flight (WebSocket or PWA support)
- Upload DJI/KML logs and parse them
- Export logs for compliance reports
- Analytics dashboard (Flight hours, locations, drone usage)
