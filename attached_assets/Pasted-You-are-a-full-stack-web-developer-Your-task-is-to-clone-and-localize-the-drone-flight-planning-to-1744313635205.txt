You are a full-stack web developer.

Your task is to clone and localize the drone flight planning tool from https://nrc.canada.ca/en/drone-tool/, replicating its user interface, logic, and map-based functionalities, while adapting all regulatory and regional content to Nepalese drone laws and CAA Nepal guidelines.

Project Scope:
âœ… Clone the full functionality and layout of the NRC drone tool, including:

The map interface (centered and restricted to Nepal)

Interactive airspace restrictions

User-driven questions (intent, location type, altitude, etc.)

Real-time response messages and regulatory advice based on user input

âœ… Map Implementation Requirements:

Use Leaflet.js, Mapbox, or similar tools to recreate the interactive map

Highlight Nepal's geographic territory only (strictly exclude Canada or global overlays)

Display restricted airspace, controlled airspace, and no-fly zones in Nepal using mock or real datasets

Mimic all layers and tooltips as shown in the Canadian tool

Use mock geospatial data for airspace zones if real data is not publicly available

âœ… Localization for Nepal:

Replace all Canada-specific content (provinces, laws, agencies) with Nepal Civil Aviation Authority equivalents

Localize all dropdowns, questions, explanations, and results per CAA Nepal drone regulations

Show localized terms and units (e.g., meters, altitude in AMSL, local languages in future)

âœ… Responsiveness and Usability:

Must be fully responsive and mobile-friendly

Design should be intuitive for Nepalese drone operators

Include multilingual support placeholder (e.g., Nepali/English switcher)

âœ… Tech Stack Recommendations:

Frontend: React.js (preferred), Tailwind CSS

Mapping: Leaflet.js, Mapbox, or OpenLayers

Backend: Optional for Phase 1 (static logic-based implementation)

Hosting: GitHub Pages, Vercel, or Netlify

âœ… Scalability:

Codebase should allow for easy expansion (e.g., drone registration system, real-time weather integration, user accounts)

Use modular components and clear state management

Constraints:
ðŸš« Do NOT use any Canadian branding, emblems, or official government symbols
ðŸš« Do NOT reference Canadian laws or transport agencies
âœ… Tool must be clearly customized for Nepalese drone pilots only
